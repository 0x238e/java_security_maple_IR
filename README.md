# java_security_maple_IR
This is a project for CS131 the Principles of Compiler in Shanghaitech based on Maple IR in OpenArkCompiler. Because it consumes a lot of time to see the security check result after compiled with the compiler, so we use the JIT bug auto detector to find the malicious action as much as possible to make the output source code a less-vulnerable one.
